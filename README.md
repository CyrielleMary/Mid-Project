# Snowfall in biathlon places
In this project, I would like to analyse the region where biathlon world cup places occur in term of snowfall, snow density and temperature.

# Why?
This project came to me when I watched the 2024 world cup in CZ where it was 7 degrees on average and the full competition was done on machine made snow.

# Documents
*Original data*: weather_indicators_RCP45.csv 

*Studied places*: Biathlon places.xlsx 
=> A file I created to get the NUTS3-ID and the altitude of the studied places

*pred_snowfall_wc_biathlon.csv // snowfall_wc_biathlon.csv(xlsx)*: Output from the Jupiter Notebook

*snowfall_wc_biathlon* = data from 2005 to 2020 

*pred_snowfall_wc_biathlon* = prediction from 2021 to 2030
